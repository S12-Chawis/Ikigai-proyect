# ðŸŒ± My Ikigai â€“ Santiago Villa

Welcome to my personal **Ikigai Web Project**, built as part of my journey at **Riwi** to explore and connect with my life purpose.

This interactive webpage represents my **Ikigai**, the Japanese concept that means *"a reason for being."* It's where my **passion**, **vocation**, **mission**, and **profession** align to form a meaningful and intentional life.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Structure

This site is a **responsive one-page web app** created with:
- **HTML5** â€“ semantic and accessible structure
- **CSS3** â€“ modern design with gradients, animations and layout via Flexbox/Grid
- **JavaScript** â€“ scroll animations, parallax effects, modal interactions, and more

It includes:
- âœ… Custom **Ikigai diagram**
- âœ… Four detailed sections:
  - **What I Love** *(Passion)*
  - **What Iâ€™m Good At** *(Vocation)*
  - **What the World Needs** *(Mission)*
  - **What I Can Be Paid For** *(Profession)*
- âœ… A reflection modal to prompt personal introspection
- âœ… Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop
