# 🌱 My Ikigai – Santiago Villa

Welcome to my personal **Ikigai Web Project**, built as part of my journey at **Riwi** to explore and connect with my life purpose.

This interactive webpage represents my **Ikigai**, the Japanese concept that means *"a reason for being."* It's where my **passion**, **vocation**, **mission**, and **profession** align to form a meaningful and intentional life.

## Project Structure

This site is a **responsive one-page web app** created with:
- **HTML5** – semantic and accessible structure
- **CSS3** – modern design with gradients, animations and layout via Flexbox/Grid
- **JavaScript** – scroll animations, parallax effects, modal interactions, and more

It includes:
-  Custom **Ikigai diagram**
-  Four detailed sections:
  - **What I Love** *(Passion)*
  - **What I’m Good At** *(Vocation)*
  - **What the World Needs** *(Mission)*
  - **What I Can Be Paid For** *(Profession)*
-  A reflection modal to prompt personal introspection
-  Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop
